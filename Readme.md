This is a representation of the fraction 4/3. 


The 2 blue circles are orbiting their respective green circles. We draw horizontal and vertical lines that go through their centers of the blue circles and plot their intersection over time. This creates a parametric plot. 

The goal was to be able to see patterns with in fractions and to see what the curves of approximations of the constants pi and e would look like.
